    "By harnessing generative AI, educators can unlock new and captivating products, enabling them to craft engaging and interactive learning experiences that promote student growth. Experts envision a future where generative AI empowers educators to revolutionize the way knowledge is imparted, paving the way for transformative educational practices.\n",

    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use large language models (LLMs) for use cases in education.  LLMs can be used for tasks such as summarization, question-answering, or the generation of question & answer pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Summarization is the task of shortening the data and creating a summary that represents the most important information present in the original text. Here, we show how to use state-of-the-art pre-trained model **Llama-2-7b-chat** for text summarization, as well all the other tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the notebook, we select and deploy the **Llama-2-7b-chat** model as a SageMaker Real-time endpoint, on a single `ml.p3.2xlarge` instance. SageMaker Real-time endpoints is ideal for inference workloads where you have real-time, interactive, low latency requirements.  These endpoints are fully managed, automatically serve your models through HTTP, and support auto-scaling.\n",

    "Once the model is deployed and ready to use, we demonstrate how it can be queried, how to prompt the model for summarization, question-answering and the generation of question & answer pairs.\n",

      "At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior, specifically quantum superposition and entanglement, using specialized hardware that supports the preparation and manipulation of quantum states.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern \"classical\" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications. Moreover, scalable quantum computers do not hold promise for many practical tasks, and for many important tasks quantum speedups are proven impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit, therefore making quantum computers nondeterministic in general. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. Paradoxically, perfectly isolating qubits is also undesirable because quantum computations typically need to initialize qubits, perform controlled qubit interactions, and measure the resulting quantum states. Each of those operations introduces errors and suffers from noise, and such inaccuracies accumulate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single ion using electromagnetic fields).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In principle, a non-quantum (classical) computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms for carefully selected tasks require exponentially fewer computational steps than the best known non-quantum algorithms. Such tasks can in theory be solved on a large-scale quantum computer whereas classical computers would not finish computations in any reasonable amount of time. However, quantum speedup is not universal or even typical across computational tasks, since basic tasks such as sorting are proven to not allow any asymptotic quantum speedup. Claims of quantum supremacy have drawn significant attention to the discipline, but are demonstrated on contrived tasks, while near-term practical use cases remain limited. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimism about quantum computing is fueled by a broad range of new theoretical hardware possibilities facilitated by quantum physics, but the improving understanding of quantum computing limitations counterbalances this optimism. In particular, quantum speedups have been traditionally estimated for noiseless quantum computers, whereas the impact of noise and the use of quantum error-correction can undermine low-polynomial speedups.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.[2] Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain the wave–particle duality observed at atomic scales,[3] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.[4] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[5] and quantum physics was essential for the nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[6]\n",

      "When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[8] prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[9][10][11]\n",

      " Sure! Here are 10 question and answer pairs based on the context:\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is a quantum computer?\n",
      "Answer: A quantum computer is a computer that takes advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform calculations exponentially faster than classical computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why can't classical physics explain the operation of quantum devices?\n",
      "Answer: Classical physics cannot explain the operation of quantum devices because quantum devices rely on quantum mechanical phenomena, which are not described by classical physics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the basic unit of information in quantum computing?\n",
      "Answer: The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, which can exist in a superposition of its two basis states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why are quantum computers nondeterministic?\n",
      "Answer: Quantum computers are nondeterministic because the result of measuring a qubit is probabilistic, meaning that it is not guaranteed what the outcome will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are some of the challenges in physically engineering high-quality qubits?\n",
      "Answer: Some of the challenges in physically engineering high-quality qubits include isolating them from their environment to prevent decoherence and introducing errors, and also initializing and manipulating qubits in a way that minimizes errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Can a classical computer solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer?\n",
      "Answer: In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time, but quantum computers have the potential to solve some problems faster due to time complexity rather than computability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is quantum complexity theory?\n",
      "Answer: Quantum complexity theory is the study of the computational resources required to solve a problem using a quantum computer, and it shows that some quantum algorithms require exponentially fewer computational steps than the best known non-quantum algorithms for certain tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are some of the near-term practical use cases for quantum computing?\n",
      "Answer: Some of the near-term practical use cases for quantum computing include breaking widely used encryption schemes and performing physical simulations, but the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science converge?\n",
      "Answer: The fields of quantum mechanics and computer science converged as physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, leading to the development of quantum computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the quantum Turing machine?\n",
      "Answer: The quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of a quantum computer that uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer, introduced in 1980 by Paul Benioff.\n"

      "you see there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tracks,\" said Piglet. \"Paw-marks.\" He gave a little squeak of\n",
      "excitement. \"Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a--a--a Woozle?\"\n",

      "another--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now proceeding\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if\n",
      "the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this\n",

      "done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather\n",
      "Trespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,\n",

      "like, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and,\n",
      "if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and\n",
      "what Christopher Robin would say. And still the tracks went on in front\n",
      "of them....\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him.\n",
      "\"_Look!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_What?_\" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn't\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The tracks!\" said Pooh. \"_A third animal has joined the other two!_\"\n",

      "and one, if so it is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them.\"\n",

      "Pooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly\n",
      "but quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so\n",

      "1.  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are state-of-the-art for sequence modeling and transduction tasks, particularly language modeling and machine translation. RNNs factor computation along input/output positions, generating hidden states sequentially, which limits parallelization in training. Recent work has improved efficiency through factorization tricks and conditional computation, while also improving model performance.\n",
      "2.  Attention mechanisms are used in sequence modeling and translation tasks, but are often combined with recurrent networks. A new model called Transformer relies solely on attention to draw global dependencies, allowing for more parallelization and improved translation quality.\n",
      "3.  In the Transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism is used to compute a representation of a sequence by relating different positions of the sequence. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks, which use sequence-aligned recurrence. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism allows it to learn dependencies between distant positions, but it also reduces the effective resolution of the attention weights due to averaging. To counteract this effect, Multi-Head Attention is used.\n",
      "4.  The Transformer is a neural sequence transduction model that relies entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output, without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. It has an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder maps an input sequence to continuous representations, and the decoder generates an output sequence one element at a time, using auto-regressive prediction. The Transformer uses stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder.\n",
      "5.  The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and decoder, each composed of multiple identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a simple fully connected feed-forward network, with residual connections and layer normalization. The decoder also includes a third sub-layer for multi-head attention over the encoder output.\n",
      "6.  The Transformer model, a type of neural network architecture, is shown to generalize well to English constituency parsing tasks, achieving high F1 scores on the WSJ dataset.\n",
      "7.  In this paper, the authors present the Transformer, a new sequence transduction model that replaces recurrent layers with attention mechanisms. The Transformer outperforms previous models, including the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar, in both the semi-supervised and supervised settings, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on translation tasks.\n",
      "8.  The Transformer model is being extended to handle input and output modalities beyond text, with a focus on efficient and non-sequential generation. The code for training and evaluating the models is available at GitHub.\n"
